Power BI dashboard analyzing customer shopping metrics to identify the trends

#  Project Overview
 
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior for a retail
company using transactional data to uncover insights that help
improve sales performance, customer engagement, and long-term
customer loyalty.

The analysis focuses on understanding how customer demographics,
product preferences, seasonality, discounts, and subscription
status influence purchasing decisions. Insights are presented
through a structured analytical process and an interactive
Power BI dashboard designed for business stakeholders.

# Business Problem Statement

A retail company observed changing purchasing patterns across
customer demographics, product categories, and sales channels.
Management wanted to better understand:

- What drives customer purchasing decisions
- Which customer segments generate the most revenue
- How discounts and subscriptions affect spending and loyalty
- How seasonal and geographic trends impact sales

# Business Question:
 How can the company leverage customer shopping data to identify
 trends, improve customer engagement, and optimize marketing and
 product strategies?

#  Dataset Overview
The dataset represents 3,900 customer transactions collected from an online retail platform.
Key Data Categories:
•	Customer Demographics Age, gender, location, subscription status
•	Purchase Information Product purchased, category, purchase amount, season, colour, size.
•	Behavioural Indicators Discount usage, purchase frequency, previous purchases, review ratings, shipping type
This data provides a holistic view of who the customers are, what they buy, and how they shop.

# Key Data Attributes:
 - Customer Demographics: Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status
 - Purchase Details: Product, Category, Purchase Amount, Season
 - Behavioral Data: Discount Usage, Purchase Frequency, Previous Purchases
 - Customer Feedback: Review Ratings

 Minor missing values were identified and addressed during the
 data preparation phase to ensure analytical accuracy.


#  Project Workflow & Methodology
# 1️⃣ Data Preparation
 - Cleaned and standardized raw data
 - Handled missing values in review ratings
 - Created derived features such as:
   • Age groups (Young Adult, Adult, Middle-aged, Senior)
   • Customer loyalty segments (New, Returning, Loyal)
   • Purchase frequency indicators

 This step ensured the dataset was reliable and ready for
 behavioral and business analysis.

# 2️⃣ Customer & Business Analysis

 The analysis focused on answering key retail business questions:

 - How spending varies across age groups and genders
 - Impact of discounts on customer purchasing behavior
 - Differences between subscribers and non-subscribers
 - Identification of loyal and high-value customers
 - Product and category performance
 - Seasonal demand trends
 - Geographic distribution of sales

 Insights were aligned with real-world retail decision-making.

# 3️⃣ Data Visualization (Power BI)

 An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to present
 insights clearly and intuitively.

 - Seasonal sales trends by category
 - Top-selling products
 - Customer segmentation filters
 - Geographic sales map

 The dashboard enables non-technical stakeholders to explore
 insights dynamically.
